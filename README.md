# periaktos
A periaktos design for theater sets.

Each side of the periaktos is a full 4'x8' sheet of 5mm plywood (AKA luan). Each periaktos sits on top of a 2' pedestal. The pedestal has a 1/2" iron pipe extending up through the center of the periaktos to keep it centered. To prevent tipping, each periaktos has a low center of gravity and the pedestal is designed accommodate extra ballast weight. The primary structural materials are 2"x4" lumber and 1/2" OSB sheathing.
